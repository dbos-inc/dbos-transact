# DBOS Typescript SDK

The DBOS SDK (from [DBOS, Inc.](https://dbos.dev)) is a **transactional serverless Typescript framework.**
DBOS fully embraces the power of your application database, helping you write backend applications that are reliable by default.
It runs your Typescript functions as database transactions, guarantees they run "once and only once" for each request, and orchestrates them into workflows so reliable that if your service is interrupted, they resume exactly where they left off.

You want to build your next database-backed application with DBOS because:

- **It's simple**.  Write your business logic using serverless functions, test them locally, and deploy them to [DBOS Cloud](https://docs.dbos.dev/getting-started/quickstart-cloud) with the push of a button.  Store all your data in Postgres&#8212;we'll manage the connections and transactions for you.
- **It's reliable by default**.  If your workflows are interrupted for any reason, they [will always resume from where they left off](https://docs.dbos.dev/tutorials/workflow-tutorial#reliability-guarantees).  Reliable message delivery is [built in](https://docs.dbos.dev//tutorials/workflow-communication-tutorial#reliability-guarantees-1). Idempotency is [built in](https://docs.dbos.dev/tutorials/idempotency-tutorial).
- **It makes debugging easy**.  With our [time travel debugger](https://docs.dbos.dev/cloud-tutorials/timetravel-debugging), you can "rewind time" and replay any DBOS Cloud trace locally on your computer, exactly as it originally happened. Whatever the issue is, we'll help you reproduce it.

## Getting Started

The fastest way to get started with DBOS is by following the [quickstart](https://docs.dbos.dev/getting-started/quickstart), where you'll learn how to get a backend running in less than five minutes.
