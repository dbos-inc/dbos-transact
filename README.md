# DBOS Typescript SDK

The DBOS SDK (from [DBOS, Inc.](https://dbos.dev)) is a **Typescript framework built on the database** that helps you develop transactional backend applications.
DBOS fully embraces the power of your application database, helping you write backend applications that are reliable by default.
It runs your Typescript functions as database transactions, guarantees they run "once and only once" for each request, and orchestrates them into workflows so reliable that if your server restarts, they resume exactly where they left off.

In the near future, DBOS Inc. expects to release a hosted cloud runtime for DBOS applications.
This scalable, secure runtime will allow you to deploy DBOS applications with the push of a button.
Also coming soon is our cloud “time-travel” debugger, which will set up and replay any scenario that occurred in production for analysis in the development environment.

## Getting Started

The fastest way to get started with DBOS is by following the [quickstart](https://docs.dbos.dev/getting-started/quickstart), where you'll learn how to get a backend running in less than five minutes.
