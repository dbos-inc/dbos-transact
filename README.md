# Operon

Operon is the programming framework for DBOS, a revolutionary system software stack developed as a research prototype over the last three years at MIT and Stanford and now commercialized by DBOS, Inc.
We're rolling out DBOS in two phases.

Starting now, we're releasing Operon, a **Typescript framework built for the database** that helps you develop database-backed backend applications.
Operon fully embraces the power of your application database, helping you write backend applications that are reliable by default.
It runs your Typescript functions as database transactions, guarantees they run "once and only once" for each request, and orchestrates them into workflows so reliable that if your server restarts, they resume exactly where they left off.

In early 2024, we'll launch DBOS, a **cloud platform built on a revolutionary new operating system** that runs OS services on top of the DBMS instead of the other way around.
This "upside-down" approach leverages the robustness and scalability of modern databases to make DBOS more secure, more resilient, and simpler than current cloud infrastructure.
It also enables powerful new capabilities, like a "time travel debugger" that uses database logs to step through any trace in your application's history to help you reproduce your most obscure bugs.
Once we release DBOS, you'll be able to serverlessly deploy any Operon application to it with the push of a button.

## Getting Started

The fastest way to get started with Operon is by following the [quickstart](https://docs.dbos.dev/getting-started/quickstart), where you'll learn how to get a backend running in less than five minutes.
