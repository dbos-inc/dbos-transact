# Operon

Operon is a **Typescript framework for the backend**.
Operon enables you to write backend applications that work right by default, providing native support for application database management, reliable workflow execution, OpenTelemetry-compatible tracing, authentication/authorization, and much more.

Unlike with other backend frameworks, your application database is a _first-class citizen_ of Operon.
Operon makes writing database operations painless for you, regardless of whether you prefer raw SQL or an ORM.
Under the hood, Operon also leverages the database to give you _reliable workflows_, so you can write programs guaranteed to run to completion despite failures and always resume where they left off when your application is restarted.

Operon is also the [**SDK for DBOS's upcoming serverless cloud platform**](https://dbos.dev).
In the near future, you'll be able to deploy any Operon application serverlessly to the cloud with the push of a button, running effortlessly at scale without worrying about managing infrastructure.

## Getting Started

The fastest way to get started with Operon is by following the [quickstart](https://docs.dbos.dev/getting-started/quickstart), where you'll learn how to get a backend running in less than five minutes.
